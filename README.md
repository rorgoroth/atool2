# atool2
[atool][1] with support for **zstd**

Given that the last release of *atool* is from *2012*, and that the maintainer is not reachable, I have created this "fork" to bring support for **zstd** into *atool*.

For an actively maintained port, look at [patool](https://github.com/wummel/patool) (in *python*). For a *lua* port, look at [satool](https://gitlab.com/kurenaiz/satool).

##### Note:
Don't expect me to add features or anything fancy, except new format support. To be honest, I don't know how to write perl code.
